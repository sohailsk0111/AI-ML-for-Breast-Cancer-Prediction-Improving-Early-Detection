# Breast Cancer Prediction using Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning

## 1. Problem Analysis (PC1)

### 1.1. Introduction

Breast cancer is a significant global health issue, representing one of the most common cancers and a leading cause of cancer-related mortality in women. Early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to improving patient outcomes and survival rates. Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) cytology is a minimally invasive and widely used diagnostic procedure for breast tumors. In this procedure, a thin needle is inserted into the breast lump to collect a sample of cells, which are then examined under a microscope by a pathologist to determine if the tumor is benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).

### 1.2. Problem Statement

The current process of diagnosing breast cancer from FNA samples is heavily reliant on the manual interpretation of cytological images by pathologists. This manual process, while effective, is subject to several limitations:

* **Subjectivity:** The interpretation of cellular features can vary between pathologists, leading to inconsistencies in diagnosis.
* **Time-Consuming:** The manual examination of slides is a labor-intensive process that can lead to delays in diagnosis, which can be critical for patients with aggressive tumors.
* **Human Error:** Pathologists, like any human, are prone to errors, especially when dealing with large volumes of cases or complex and ambiguous samples.
* **Expertise Gap:** The accuracy of diagnosis is highly dependent on the experience and expertise of the pathologist. In regions with a shortage of trained pathologists, this can lead to a higher rate of misdiagnosis.

These challenges highlight the need for a more objective, efficient, and reliable diagnostic support system. Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) offer a promising solution to augment the diagnostic process and address the limitations of manual interpretation.

### 1.3. Key Parameters

* **Issue to be Solved:** To develop a machine learning model that can accurately classify breast tumors as benign or malignant based on cytological features from FNA samples.
* **Target Community:** The primary users of this system will be pathologists and oncologists. The system will act as a diagnostic aid, providing a second opinion and helping to reduce the workload of medical professionals.
* **User Needs and Preferences:** The system should be:
    * **Accurate and Reliable:** The model's predictions should be highly accurate to be trusted by medical professionals.
    * **Fast and Efficient:** The system should provide results in a timely manner to expedite the diagnostic process.
    * **Easy to Use:** The user interface should be intuitive and require minimal training.
    * **Interpretable:** The system should be able to provide insights into its decision-making process, allowing pathologists to understand the basis of the prediction.




## 2. Requirements Assessment (PC2)

### 2.1. Functional Requirements

Functional requirements define the specific functionalities that the system must perform. For the breast cancer prediction system, the functional requirements are:

*   **Data Input:** The system must be able to accept input data containing the cytological features extracted from FNA samples. This data will likely be in a structured format, such as a CSV file.
*   **Data Preprocessing:** The system should be able to preprocess the input data to handle missing values, normalize features, and prepare the data for the machine learning model.
*   **Model Training:** The system must provide a mechanism to train the machine learning model on a labeled dataset of breast cancer cases.
*   **Tumor Classification:** The core functionality of the system is to classify a given tumor as benign or malignant based on the input features.
*   **Prediction Output:** The system must display the prediction result to the user in a clear and understandable format.
*   **Performance Evaluation:** The system should provide metrics to evaluate the performance of the model, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

### 2.2. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements define the quality attributes of the system. These are crucial for ensuring that the system is not only functional but also usable, reliable, and secure.

*   **Accuracy:** The model must achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying tumors. A minimum accuracy of 95% is desirable to ensure the reliability of the predictions.
*   **Performance:** The system should be able to provide a prediction in near real-time, ideally within a few seconds.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing volume of data and user requests without a significant degradation in performance.
*   **Security:** The system must ensure the privacy and security of patient data. Access to the system should be restricted to authorized users.
*   **Usability:** The user interface should be simple, intuitive, and easy to navigate for medical professionals who may not have a background in machine learning.
*   **Reliability:** The system should be robust and available for use when needed. It should handle errors gracefully and provide informative feedback to the user.

*   **Number of Features:** 30 continuous features
*   **Target Classes:** 2 (Benign and Malignant)
*   **Missing Values:** None
*   **Data Type:** All features are real-valued

### 6.2. Feature Description

The features in the dataset are computed from digitized images of Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) of breast masses. For each cell nucleus in the image, ten real-valued features are computed:

1. **Radius:** Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter
2. **Texture:** Standard deviation of gray-scale values
3. **Perimeter:** Perimeter of the nucleus
4. **Area:** Area of the nucleus
5. **Smoothness:** Local variation in radius lengths
6. **Compactness:** Perimeter² / area - 1.0
7. **Concavity:** Severity of concave portions of the contour
8. **Concave Points:** Number of concave portions of the contour
9. **Symmetry:** Symmetry of the nucleus
10. **Fractal Dimension:** "Coastline approximation" - 1

For each of these ten features, three measurements are provided:
*   **Mean:** The mean value across all nuclei in the image
*   **Standard Error:** The standard error of the mean
*   **Worst:** The mean of the three largest values

This results in a total of 30 features (10 × 3 = 30).

### 6.3. Exploratory Data Analysis

The exploratory data analysis revealed several important insights about the dataset:

*   **Data Quality:** The dataset contains no missing values, which simplifies the preprocessing pipeline.
*   **Feature Ranges:** The features have different scales, with some features like area having much larger values than others like fractal dimension.
*   **Feature Correlations:** Many features show strong correlations, particularly between related measurements (e.g., radius, perimeter, and area).

### 6.4. Data Preprocessing Steps

The following preprocessing steps were implemented:

1. **Data Loading:** The dataset was loaded using scikit-learn's `load_breast_cancer()` function.
